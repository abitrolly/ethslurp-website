<h3>Welcome to EthSlurp</h3>

    <p>EthSlurp allows you to 'slurp' the Ethereum blockchain extracting
        transactions from any Ethereum address, including smart contracts
        and store those transactions easily in familiar file formats such
        as .csv or .txt. For example,

        <pre><big> ethslurp 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</big></pre>

    <p>returns all transactions from "The DAO." This data is available
        in many places, but until now it wasn't easy to consume.</p>

    <p>This is where EthSlurp comes in. The formatting option makes the
        JSON gobbeldy-gook easy to read.</p>

        <pre><big> ethslurp -f 0x713B73c3994442b533e6A083eC968e40606810Ec</big></pre>

    <p>It's even better than that. The output from EthSlurp is fully
        customizable, allowing you to choose which data fields to export,
        which data fields to ignore, the format of the data, and even which
        summary fields to include, if any.</p>

    <p>For example, by adding an option to the -f command, you can
        create tab delimited text file, comma seperated .csv file
        that will open directly in MS Excel, or an even rudimentary HTML.

        <pre><big> ethslurp -f:txt  0x713B73c3994442b533e6A083eC968e40606810Ec<br> ethslurp -f:csv  0x713B73c3994442b533e6A083eC968e40606810Ec<br> ethslurp -f:html 0x713B73c3994442b533e6A083eC968e40606810Ec</big></pre>

    <p>There are many other options detailed fully in the <a href=doc_home.html>documentation</a>.<p>

<h3>Why would I want to slurp the blockchain?</h3>

    <p>Let's say you've deployed your own smart contract. How do will you
        know what's going on? Using EthSlurp's -date option and some simple
        script automation, you could generate a daily report and have it
        emailed to your inbox. Wouldn't it be nice know if your smart
        contract is making any money?

<h3>Yeah, but show me an example</h3>

    <p>How's this:
