<h3>Welcome to EthSlurp</h3>

    <p>EthSlurp allows you to 'slurp' the Ethereum blockchain extracting
        transactions from any Ethereum address, including smart contracts.
        For example,

    <pre><big> ethslurp 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</big></pre>

    <p>returns all transactions, both in to and out of, "The DAO."
        If you run the above command--don't it takes a long time--you
        will get JSON formatted data, in other words, computer gobbeldy-gook.

    <p>This is where EthSlurp comes in. Using the formatting (-f) option
        you can make the output human readable.

        <pre><big> ethslurp -p 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</big></pre>

    <p>It's even better than that. The format of the output is fully customizable
        using a feature called <a href=display_strings.html>display strings</a>. Choose
        which fields to include, which fields to ignore, and exactly what format
        the output takes.

    <p>For example, by changing a single line in a configuration file, you can
        create a tab delimited text file, a comma seperated .csv file that will
        open directly in MS Excel, or an HTML web page. There are many other
        options detailed fully in our <a href=documentation.html>documentation</a>.<p>

<h3>Why would I need to do that?</h3>

    <p>Let's say you've deployed a smart contract. How do you know what's
        going on with it? With EthSlurp you can create the information you
        need to fully account for all the incoming and outgoing ether in
        your contact. You can even filter the transactions by date. Wouldn't
        it be nice to finally know on a monthly or weekly basis if your
        contracts are even making any money?

<h3>Yeah, but show me an example</h3>

    <p>How's this: <a target=top href=statement.html>Monthly
        Statement for XYZ Smart Contract</a>


<h3>Building the software</h3>

    <p>Currently (pre-beta), we do not provide binaries (mostly because we
        don't know how). You must download the source code and compile it
        yourself--but don't worry--it's extremely easy. Information on building
        the software is provided on the <a href=documentation.html>documentation</a>
        page.

    <p>We also do not know how to make a full-fledged package. There may be a few
        dependencies which may not resolve during the build. Please contact us
        if that happens, and we will respond quickly. Email us with questions:
        <a href="mailto:info@ethslurp.com">info@ethslurp.com</a></p>

<h3>Cautions and warnings</h3>

    <p>This software is pre-beta. We are constantly working to make the software
        as robust as possible, but we're still in the early phases. Use the software
        at your own risk. We make no representation as to its fitness for any
        purpose. The software is provided as is, and is hereby released into
        the public domain.</p>
