<h3>Welcome to EthSlurp</h3>

    <p>EthSlurp allows you to 'slurp' the Ethereum blockchain extracting
        transactions from any Ethereum address, including smart contracts
        and, from there, store these transactions in familiar file formats
        such as .csv (MS Excel) or .txt. For example,</p>

        <pre><big> ethslurp 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413</big></pre>

    <p>returns all transactions to and from "The DAO." This data is publically
        available elsewhere, but never this easily accessible. Until now the
        best you could hope for was computer gobbeldy-gook.</p>

    <p>This is where EthSlurp shines. The formatting option makes the
        gobbeldy-gook easy to read.</p>

        <pre><big> ethslurp -f 0x713B73c3994442b533e6A083eC968e40606810Ec</big></pre>

    <p>It's even better than that. The output from EthSlurp is fully
        customizable, allowing you to choose which transaction fields to
        include, which fields to ignore, the format of the data files, and
        even which summary fields to include, if any.</p>

    <p>For example, by adding an option to the -f command line, you can
        create a tab delimited text file, a comma seperated .csv file
        that will open directly in MS Excel, or even rudimentary HTML.</p>

        <pre><big> ethslurp -f:txt  0x713B73c3994442b533e6A083eC968e40606810Ec<br> ethslurp -f:csv  0x713B73c3994442b533e6A083eC968e40606810Ec<br> ethslurp -f:html 0x713B73c3994442b533e6A083eC968e40606810Ec</big></pre>

    <p>There are many other options detailed fully in the <a href=doc_home.html>documentation</a>.<p>

<h3>Why would anyone want to slurp the blockchain?</h3>

    <p>Let's say you've deployed your own smart contract. How will you
        know what's going on? Using EthSlurp's -date option and some simple
        script automation, you could generate a daily report and have it
        emailed to your inbox. Wouldn't it be nice know if your smart
        contract is making money?</p>

<h3>Yeah, but show me an example</h3>

    <p>How's this:

<h3>Building the software</h3>

    <p>We provide full open-source code in an easily compiled version. Don't worry--it's
        easy to build. There are no external dependancies, so there's nothing to download
        except our code. Information on building the software is provided in the
        <a href=doc_home.html>documentation</a>.</p>

    <p>Contact us if you have any trouble running EthSlurp. We try to respond as quickly
        as we can. Email us with questions: <a href="mailto:info@greathill.com">info@ethslurp.com</a></p>

<h3>Cautions and warnings</h3>

    <p>While we are constantly improving the software, trying to make it as robust
        and easy to use as possible, it is still beta. Use the software at your
        own risk. We make no representation as to the software's fitness for
        any purpose. Nor do we claim that the data it produces is accurate. The
        software is provided as is, and its source code is hereby released
        into the public domain.</p>
