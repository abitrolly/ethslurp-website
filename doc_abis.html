<h3>Application Binary Interface (ABI) Files</h3>

    <p>The first time you slurp an Ethereum address you may simply tell
        it an address. If, however, you additionally provide an ABI (Application
        Binary Interface) file, EthSlurp can do so much more. We won't explain
        what an ABI is (Google it), but it's worth learning if you don't know.</p>

<h3>Parsing the Ethereum Input Data Field</h3>

    <p>Ethereum transactions are very like Bitcoin transactions, in the sense that they
        include at least three fields: <b>from_account</b>, <b>to_account</b>, and <b>transaction_amount</b>.
        This makes perfect sense. How else would one transfer money between accounts. Of course, there are
        <a href="doc_dispstr.html">other data fields</a>, but one in particular is of
        interest to us. That fields is called <b>input</b>.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin has an <b>input</b> field, but it has at most 80 bytes of storage. This is
        one of the important differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ethereum's <b>input</b> field
        can be of any length. Why is this important? Becuase the <b>input</b> field is how
        Ethereum passes along its function calls.</p>

    <p>This is the contents of a typical Ethereum data field:</p>

    <pre><code>    0xc9d27afe
    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ff
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001</code></pre>

    <p>Computer gobbeldy-gook again. Using the information we find in the contract's
        ABI, EthSlurp is able to convert this string into this function call:</p>

    <pre><code>    vote(255,”Yea”)</code></pre>

    <p>Which, because this is The DAO's transaction represents a user voting on one of the
        proposals. Another transaction:</p>

        <pre><code>    0x23b872dd
    000000000000000000000000bf6cc4a882ace8e3a19bb8f5372280b33b2f6c9e
    000000000000000000000000fbb1b73c4f0bda4f67dca266ce6ef42f520fbb98
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000056bc75e2d63100000</code></pre>

        <p>might transalte to this:</p>

        <pre><code>    transferFrom(0xbf6cc4a882ace8e3a19bb8f5372280b33b2f6c9e,
                 0xfbb1b73c4f0bda4f67dca266ce6ef42f520fbb98,
                 -1)</code></pre>

        <p>which, in the case of The DAO, means move all DAO tokens in the first account to the
            second account (-1 is the largest possible unsigned integer: 2<sup>256-1</sup>,
            in effect this means move 'all' the ether).</p>

<h3>And This Matters Why?</h3>

        <p>We beleive that EthSlurp is the only currently available software
            that displays the Ethereum function calls for a known contract in
            a human readable way. This allows us to seperate transactions based on
            function signature as we've done <a href="http://daodeepdive.com/data.html">here</a>.
            It also allows us to "see activity on contracts that would be very
            difficult to see otherwise> Recently, the WhiteHat DAO curators added their
            own address to the DarkDAO's whitelist. We saw this activity a full twelve
            hours before it was announced as is
            <a href="https://twitter.com/ethslurp/status/752954842528743424">demonstrated here</a>.</p>

        <p>Stay tuned. There's more to come.</p>
