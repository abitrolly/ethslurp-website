<h3>Installing and building the software</h3>

    <p>At the top if this and every page are buttons to download
        the source code for this project. This should download and
        unpack itself into a folder. In that folder, you will find
        a file called INSTALL. Follow the simple instructions
        in the INSTALL file to build and run EthSlurp.

<h3>Usage:</h3>

<pre><code><h3>
 ethslurp [-i|-e|-d|-f[:fmt]|-l|-s|-o|-b|-c|-v|-h] addr

 Fetches data off the Ethereum block chain for an
 arbitrary account or smart contract. Optionally
 formats the output to your specification.

 Where:
   addr	the address of the account or contract to slurp
   -i	include income transactions only
   -e	include expenditures only
   -d	specify date range as 'start-[end]' (yyyymmdd[:hhmmss])
   -f	pretty print, optionally add ':txt,' ':csv,' or ':html'
   -l	re-display most recent (last) slurp
   -s	force EthSlurp to take a slurp (ignore cached data)
   -o	open output in an associated editor
   -b	save a date stamped backup of the previous slurp
   -c	clear all previously cached slurps
   -v	verbose: -v1 for minimal debug output, -v3 for max
   -h	display this help screen
</code></pre>

<h3>Running the software the first time</h3>
    <p>The first time you run EthSlurp, it will ask you for an
        API key from the <a href=http://etherscan.io/apis>http://etherscan.io/apis</a>
        website. We have to do this because if we didn't, and used
        our own API key, and we got a non-zero install base, the
        number of requests to ehterscan.io would exceed the limit
        of api calls per second. If each user supplies their own
        API key, this problem is alliviated.

<h3>Cached data</h3>
    <p>EthSlurp pulls data from the block chain under three scenarios:
        (1) the first time you slurp an address, (2) on subsequent
        slurps of the same address if the previous slurp is older than
        five minutes, and (3) if you supply the '-s' flag. At all other
        times, EthSlurp pulls its data from a locally stored cache.
        This is necessary to minimize the number of times the program
        hits the etherscan.io apis and improve performance. You may
        change the refresh rate in a <a href=config.html>configuration file</a>.

<h3>Planned improvements</h3>
    <p>The primary improvement we hope to provide in the future
        would be to pull the data directly from the Ethereum
        block chain as opposed to hitting up etherscan.io's web
        apis. This will greatly improve the performance of the
        software and remove the five minute caching requirement.
        Additionally, you will no longer need an etherscan.io
        API key.
