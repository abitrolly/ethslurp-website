<h3>Installing and building the software</h3>

    <p>At the top of this and every page are buttons to download
        the source code for this project. This should download and
        unpack itself into a folder. In that folder, you will find
        a file called INSTALL. Follow the simple instructions
        in the INSTALL file to build and run EthSlurp.

<h3>Usage:</h3>

<pre><code><h3>
 ethslurp [-b|-c|-d|-e|-f|-i|-l|-m|-o|-r|-s|-t|-v|-h] addr

 Fetches data off the Ethereum blockchain for an
 arbitrary account or smart contract. Optionally,
 ethslurp formats the output to your specification.

 Where:
   addr the address of the account or contract to slurp (required)
   -i	include income transactions only
   -e	include expenditures only
   -d	specify date range as '[:start:[end]]' (yyyymmdd[hhmmss])
   -f	pretty print, optionally add ':txt,' ':csv,' or ':html'
   -l	list previously slurped addresses in cache
   -m	maximum number of transactions to slurp (100000)
   -r	re-run the most recent slurp
   -s	force EthSlurp to take a slurp (ignore cached data)
   -o	open the configuration file for editing
   -b	export records in block range (:0[:max])
   -c	clear all previously cached slurps
   -v	verbose: -v1 for minimal debug output, -v3 for max
   -h	display this help screen
</code></pre>

<h3>Running the software the first time</h3>
    <p>The first time you run EthSlurp, it will ask you for an
        API key from the <a href=http://etherscan.io/apis>http://etherscan.io/apis</a>
        website. We have to do this because if we didn't, and used
        our own API key, and we got a non-zero install base, the
        number of requests to ehterscan.io would exceed the limit
        of api calls per second. If each user supplies their own
        API key, this problem is alliviated.

<h3>Cached data</h3>
    <p>EthSlurp pulls data from the blockchain under three scenarios:
        (1) the first time you slurp an address, (2) on subsequent
        slurps of the same address if the previous slurp is older than
        five minutes, and (3) if you supply the '-s' flag. At all other
        times, EthSlurp pulls its data from a locally stored cache.
        This is necessary to minimize the number of times the program
        hits the etherscan.io apis and improve performance. You may
        change the refresh rate in a <a href=doc_config.html>configuration file</a>.

<h3>Planned improvements</h3>
    <p>The primary improvement we hope to provide in the future
        would be to pull the data directly from the Ethereum
        blockchain as opposed to using a web api such as etherscan.io.
        This will greatly improve the performance of the
        software and remove the five minute caching requirement.
        Furthermore, it will remove the dependency that currently
        exists on an external website. Additionally, our end
        users will no longer need an etherscan.io API key.<p>

    <p>Another primary area of improvement will be in the long-term
        storage of cached data, which is currently implemented in
        a sub-optimal way.</p>

    <p>The final major area for improvement will be in the area
        of summarizing data at the page level. Currently we provide
        only a rudimentary level of summarization data, listing
        instead only transaction data.</p>
